What they say of Rome,
In that world the togas called home,
That when it comes time to go,
And collapse is sure to come,
Pay no mind to Ceasar or Nero,
When it's lifeblood drains to zero.

Let it accelerate its own decline,
Even if the Ceasar does not resign.

It shall spring forth,
Many beautiful Romance languages,
Come forth the many thanks,
And many ways to say goodbye.

To speak together one can only try.
There may be some warring tribes,
For the people that were once slaves.
For their rebellion don't ask why.
Just realize the damage will come,
And it will soon fade.

Let the sword drain blood,
Let it drain the blood of life.
