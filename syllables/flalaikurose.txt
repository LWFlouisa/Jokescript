Few words dot page,
In this old age.
Written.
Notes in her hand,
Hair in a band.
So tight
Is the band around,
In this world abound
Holding
				Roses
				In hair,
				Glissens.

With her dress so torn
And her hair adorn
With the roses
Only the shadows on
The wall linger, gone

Are the roses
In her dark hair flowing
All down her cheeks.
