When we live in a police state,
Our nation is increasingly third rate,
Someone has to answer the call,
It's no super hero after the fall.
If only we could see the signs sooner,
While we're entertained by Space Movies and screamers.

Only in space movies can we long to dream,
And in horror movies that make us scream.
But reality is not for adventures or the shadows on the wall.
If only we could se the signs sooner,
What we need is no super hero after tha fall.

Many seem to think it's a Trump thing,
When the old Liberty Bell cracks and no longer sings.
Reality like broken doves wings, behold a crow that reigns supreme,
The liberty bell no longer sings, and those who call for liberty are no better.

The US had always been this way,
The current presidents only took it out of hiding,
A horse more subtle than the horseman of the apocalypse galloping.
Whether it's the nature of polution,
Or the government filled with overt corruption,
The only bell that sings are in historical movies.

Movies of a distant time,
Long before the marching police state.
