Un renslita da rita hakucho uta.
Be the one that stands alone.
Un renslita da rita hakucho uta.
Other the others fall behind, don't fall back.

In the politics there is a thing called solidarity,
But it was not designed to platform the right.
Un renslita da rita hakucho uta.
It was designed to be that answer to the night.

For the hungry, to full their desires.
To fulfill the dream of midnight starlight reves.
Un renslita da rita hakucho uta.
Lets fulfill the midnight desires.

Lets give in to our individual desires,
Lets us give bread and communion to the dead.
Un renslita da rita hakucho uta,
Lets us give into our better desires,

Yet let us fulfill ourselves first,
As can't help anyone else.
If we're dead.
