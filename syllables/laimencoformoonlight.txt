Sunlight now looms
Over the flower
Blooms.
The rosebuds fall
In the colder months.
The fall
So cold its short twigs
Fall to the brig.
Blooms...

They are now dusting
Before snow is coming...
Midnight shadows

Under the moonlight,
Staring into the light,
The goddess greets
Now the wolves tonight,
As they howl to the light.

Sunlight now looms,
Over the flower
Blooms.

Tonight.
