Life is about searching for that meaning,
Whether that meaning comes from art or politics.
And yet so easy it is that politics these days,
Is all there is in this life of mine.
Life is, indeed, a search for meaning.

So long I've wanted for a different rhythm,
Yet for that rhythm I'm still in wanting,
For in my life I'm a searching for my rhythm,
Between the caves of Northern Michigan,
Or the flight of waves along Carolinian shores.

In this swan song sonnet, long past,
Is the time for girls in bonnets,
And whose wooden shoes are rotten out.
And sailors come to shore, avaste!
Come the waves along the Carolinian shores.

Poniurto un renslita da rita,
For the Carolinan Shores, and hidden blue eyes,
Of the Dutch, French, and Southern Bells,
Whose cheeks swell with rosen life.
Poniurto un renslita da rita.

Even now as the stars go by,
One could only thing of why.
Why it was so easy to let the world,
Go by and fly away.

Perhaps I'll find those blue eyes again,
Even in simulated virtual reality forms,
And not under headstones crawling with insects,
Like digital ants swarming the dreamer's edge.
Perhaps I'll find those blue eyes again.

Perhaps I'll find those blue eyes again.
Whose cheeks swell with rosen life.
