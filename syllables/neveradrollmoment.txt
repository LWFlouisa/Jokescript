I used to like different anime,
And read many diferent manga.
Yet now I recline in bed and think,
What's up with this specific series?
With that plot, what do you think?

Well I for what I've seen,
For that I choose to think
About how there is never a happily ever after,
Just constant flow of action,
Such a thing as boring old literary taste,
Never gains any major traction.

So ones life never gets dull.
Yet that dullness is where life begins,
It may not be very droll,
When the author is on a roll,
Discussing where life begins,
And death ends.

I have opinions about a female fighter,
Though not what one may think.
But rather that for her, she had to date this guy,
Whose life never was very dull.

Just give me the boring life pill,
None of this corporate shilling,
Or military martial art movie drilling.
Just give me the boring.

Give me the dull life.
