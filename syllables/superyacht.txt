While Bezos sits on his super Yacht,
And people argue against Trump for naught,
Only those who have so little time to spare,
Can argue about the coloring in their hair.

I once knew a guy who had dreadlocks,
While dismissing women's taste in birkenstocks.
Instead he uses video streaming channels,
To bend back his dreadlocks,
And act suave with his unshaven facial locks.

With so little time people can spare,
You'd think they'd share a common language,
Or have something of value to share.
Instead they bicker about and shout,
To the language in an encoded post.

While plastering their hypocracy everywhere.
And yet, I'm the one who should be ashamed,
To like anime girls in Birkenstocks.
