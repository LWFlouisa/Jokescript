Spiders living by my bed,
One is dangling by my head
As its shape begins to grow,
It makes solace beyond the snow,
	Where a fireplace always burns.

By my beside it sways forth
In a cabin, in a valley
	Of the north,
It waits silently,
	Webbing defiantly.

Closet lurks beyond my door,
Where voices, other inhabitants,
Watch me sleep, as I snore,
Others staring through my window,

And my friend, is the recluse,
	Beyond my door.
