I once wanted to draw comics,
Or as least write scripts,
Instead I get badgered,
By other mangaka requesting tips.

It's that way with politics too,
If I go left, they go right,
And if I go right, they go left,
It's almost like they lack principles,
To pick a side and stick with it.

No conviction to be themselves,
It's all about being that contrary,
Sometimes I wish my life were ordinary,
Instead I only have myself.

I suppose that's why I write on here,
Maybe save some time to be myself,
So I can be anywhere, myself,
And not be judged by others.

I once wanted to draw comics,
I once wanted to be on breadtube.
I had many things I once wanted to do.

But instead I comment on women's shoes,
While typing short stories in the blues.
