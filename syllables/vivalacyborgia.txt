She was less than eighteen,
	When she ripped out her boyfriend's spleen.
Perhaps it was for a minor thing,
	Or something much more severe.
But what we know is she's Cyborgia.
	And was less than eighteen,
When she committed her crime.
	And died at less than nineteen.

Viva La Cyborgia.
Viva La Cyborgia.

The guillotine was sharp an angular,
	Much more like a sword and not an ax.
The only girl to die so young by the blade,
	And for why? None of your bees wax.
As her head fell down, losing her cybernetics,
	She saw, for a brief moment,
Only the guillotine blade.
	Viva La Cyborgia.

At less than eighteen, only a child,
	But the girl was Cyborgia, and quite wild.
Perhaps in another life, she will live again.
	To see a revolution, and not a blade,
Viva La Cyborgia.

Viva La Cyborgia.
Viva La Cyborgia.
