When your young they say you want a hero.
But I’ve always liked my villains,
To suck them through the marrow.
Dead or alive, I’ve liked my villains.

Not because I liked their behaviour,
Or the flowing locks of hair.
But the desire to fix the broken,
Not for their behavior.

Whether it’s in a noose or a guillotine,
Or with a crown viewing an army of demons,
Or sawing a snake in half.
The villains blood on floor,
Dripping from the blade of a guillotine.

My taste in their red fluid,
Flowing down my neck with gusto.
All that and a bag of corn chips.
My taste in their red fluid,
Like fine dining, without food sharing.

In my own personal cavern,
Where I’m the only one there,
It doesn’t matter if I’m strange,
The only one there deranged.

With knuckles twisting and popping,
Like the sound of cracking necks.
My forest of the inner life,
With falling crows, cracking necks,
And scarecrows by the dozen.

In the nearest village is a noose,
For those who stole a moose,
And a guillotine for those more cut throat.
And a dock where fishermen float.

Welcome to my portal,
To my own secret midnight garden,
With cyborg paladins, and beheaded nuns.
Who may have nice guns, and roses in their hair.

Welcome to nevermore.
Welcome to nevermore.
