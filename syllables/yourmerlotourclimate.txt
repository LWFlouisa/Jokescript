You can tap dance on a roof with a French pop starlet,
Or wet your pants to Merlot.
But when you pull the trigger, and plug the gas,
With your hand, it's our climate,
And us all pummelled in the ass.

I went through a time, when I was Nihilistic,
Now I'm simply less vocal, but I'm still pessimistic.
In that time, so long ago, when I was one of you,
I lived my life with fear of guillotines and wooden shoes,
Yet how much of a waste it is to be so hateful,
	When a foreign wife can be so delightful.

That's why it's so important,
To not react instinctfully to pop culture,
Preying on our world like a vulture.
Instead to simply tap dance on a roof with a French pop starlet,
	Drop that glass of merlot.

You can be for the revolution,
Even if you're also a robot,
It doesn't matter if you're flesh or metal,
You can be for the revolution,
	In your own small way.

With your hand, it's our climate,
And us all pummelled in the ass.
