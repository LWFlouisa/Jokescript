Behold the saber
That cut through the
Windows
It knows not a light
Or a sweet calming
Goodnight.
The noose so tight
The song grips tightly
Tonight.

Perhaps it should have all been clear,
That there would not be a savior all year.
Instead, even as the wind turns,
And the houses of a commune burns,
The water wheels turn all the year.

Behold the saber
That cut through the
Windows
It knows not a light
Or a sweet calming
Goodnight.
The noose so tight
The song grips tightly
Tonight.

Not a Flamenco song
But another wistful chant,
Peace is scant
Under the weeping,
Willow tree tonight.

That it seems, that all I have,
Is a wish for a restful goodnight.
Yet so few and far between,
Is a man with a spine and a spleen.
Instead under the pressure they buckle,
To the Willow army, to the Dragon master’s cult,
Who armed with a saber and his bolts,
Would rally with his scornful cults.
Solemnly one may choose to swear,
Under that gazeful near noir hair.
But one can’t hide the innate fear,
Of the willow army’s stare.
Radioactive werewolves, realms of decay,
One looks on into the barren wilderness,
And feels only a sense of decay.

Behold the saber
That cut through the
Windows
It knows not a light
Or a sweet calming
Goodnight.
The noose so tight
The song grips tightly
Tonight.

Peace is scant
Under the weeping,
Willow tree tonight.
