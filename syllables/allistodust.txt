My life in two
For this one tune
Longing.
For the
Release
From pain.

It's easy to be someone who wants a fan,
And for them to do anything you can.
Yet for me it's not so simple for this like of mine.
You're a fool if you find them so divine.
What I'm a fan of that is only mine.
Suppose instead I gave you an ear,
But instead it's only lectured throughout the year.
Sometimes its better to be on your own.
Even if that means only silence,
Than to live with regrets and no love
For the art of your special silence.
That silence inside your mind,
Louder than all the Earth, in its girth,
There is a morbid fascination in obscurity,
Even if it gives only anxieties.
Under this ungrateful soul called the Earth.

My life in two
For this one tune
Longing.
For the
Release
From pain.

It was a personal self-destruction,
That they called my subversive desires.
For my soul I was consumed entire.
Personal nihilism darting out,
Like fireworks burning in a fire.
Everything is all vivid and visceral,
Like the pain of losing your eyesight,
In the looming sunset,
And then you only say goodnight.
There was a time I had a temper,
But when you grow old and tired,
Sometimes it's better to whimper and let it go
Melt away, and say goodnight.

My life in two
For this one tune
Longing.
For the
Release
From pain.

To think that I am only dust,
Just an insignificant speck of rust
In this morning of burned trusts,
When all the world has turned to rust
And beneath this decayed Earth called the crust
Are different forms of metallic debris,
Everything is beneath the rotten crust.
It doesn't matter who it is you love.
When there is nobody you can trust,
Beneath the rotten Earth in it crust.
It was a personal self-destruction,
That they called my subversive desires.

Sometimes it's better to whimper and let it go
Melt away, and say goodnight.
