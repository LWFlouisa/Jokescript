Sometimes I wish it wasn't so,
That when I listen to others get together,
I'll soon clock out, I'm soon to go
Hayware under dimly lit lamp.
    But I truck on like a champ.

Even when my mind melts down.
I'm not sure who was the clown,
Who thought it was a good idea,
To watch a video and simmer down.

Recline to old music,
And relive old activist memories,
To turn of the clock.
