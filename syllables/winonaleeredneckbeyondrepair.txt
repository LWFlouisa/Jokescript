I said I was from Tennessee,
Born and raised here.
She said she was from Texas,
And moved from Las Vegas.
So I asked her, when we first met,
How she decided to move to Tennessee.

She thought I was bad in bed,
I told her, she simply never asked.
The truth is, we never had sex,
As we slept in a seperate bed.

When we met it was in a motel,
Where having a clean toilet and bath tub,
Was the thing that was amazing,
And the rest of it was hell.

When we broke up, it was with regards,
We never thought of each other as retards.
What she thought was I was bad in bed,
I thought she was a redneck beyond repair.

As we slept in seperate beds,
We brushed each other's hair.

We went seperate ways,
Down the road from Tennessee.
Back to Las Vegas and Texas,
Only later back to Tennessee.

When she was in Las Vegas,
She learned a lot about the language of combat.
I thought she was quite the wombat.
But she spoke it with Texas yoddling.

And when she came back to me,
The reason she left for good,
After once again, wanting to see me,
Was that died overseas.

Now I have her earn of ashes,
Sitting on my Chimney top,
Living with a girl named Ashley,
Who only barely knew of Winona Lee.
And now we only know her as as vase,
For all that we see.

Winona died as she lived,
The girl from Texas and Los Vegas,
And now she was a vase, for all that see.
