Now is the time, for a new told story,
Where deer run and play, in this new story.
In the forest, of the night, children of the night,
Run throuh the fields, that plant new seed.
Where the flowers were there to stay.

Where windmills spin, round o'round,
Little boys an girls, running with hounds,
Only the rain, gave some torment,
As it poured in its slight torrent,
Beneath the clear blue sky.

Where plants were there to stay,
Where deer run and play, and cross the street,
Beware crossing of the street,

A simple life, beyond the forest
Of night.
