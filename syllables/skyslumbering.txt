The unfocused
Thoughts focused
Longing.
	I seek my mind
	In a constant sleeping
	Gazing, slumbering.
Now searching for
A distant shore
Sailing.
	Sea thickened
	Sky clouds blowing softly
	Hissing in the wind.
Seeing abyss
Hearing wind whizz
Blowing.
	I seek my mind
	In a constant sleeping
	Gazing, slumbering.
