Anna-Marie with her
Shotgun, walked with spurs
Barely attached
To her boots. Shivers.

Vert montagna drips
Sprinkling, sprinkling acid rain...
Crackling thunder claps.

The sunset goes down, raindrops to the dirt,
Not a time for death, or a fast growth spurt.
Midnight horizon, the darkness of closet noir.
No more churches or blasphemy when the dead
Does not hop from their graves, falling head
First into another oblivion, total darkness
All surrounds the illusion of one's life.
Dreams that match the inner darkness, wilting
Birth the decaying flowers, bye spring silking
Never worn by the brides of the crypt, shaking
Down to their very core, death on ancient shore.
A line of lively poetry, clipped short.

Anna-Marie with her
Shotgun, walked with spurs
Barely attached
To her boots. Shivers.

Montagna vert
During the off season...
All else corvid season.

Illusion
Of life and death.
