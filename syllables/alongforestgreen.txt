Can you see the mountains,
As the water pours from the fountain.
Can you see the cloudless sky,
As it rains down from above.

Can you see the deer running,
Along the forest green,
Chased by a wolf, that's cunning,
Running to eat the deer.

Everything all along mountain green,
Where the children hunt, along with jumping rope,
They are all hunting, along mountain green.
To see a strange new world.

All along the mountain,
Deer and fae live near fountains.

Along the forest green.
