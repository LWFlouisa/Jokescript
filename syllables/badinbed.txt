I went through a time, when I was bad in bed,
I thought she was a personal self-destruction,
That they called my subversive desires.

Give me the boring.
Within the weeds blowing,
Blowing in the long run,
When you obsess of Rospierre.
What she thought was I was young.

Whether that was amazing,
And the rest of it was a vase, for all that is now left, rotting so profane.
But rather that for her, she simply never asked.
Flexible as frayed electrical wires.

It crawls on my thin skin.
Now searching for my rhythm,
Between the Savanna and the profane.

There was once a friend who led their life with their mind,
While I let my emotions about issues unwind.
The far left lost the need for a lovely girl.
Jean Ferrat de France.
