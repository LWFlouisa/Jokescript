So long ago in my youth,
When I was still so young,
I had nobody to turn to, so long ago.
Yet now it is but a memory,
Of when I was young.

I had a friend who waltzed about.
To have a good time, he liked to shout.
And courted me with others of our kind,
And was there when I was in a bind.

Yet, somehow the memory fades,
Like everything else in life.
And I remember his last statement to me,
"I'm going to make a decision,
And it might change our lives."
I used to collect knives,
Though they couldn't make an encision.

My fetishes have other things,
Other things it derives.
From the deepest part of the mind.

Perhaps in retrospect, I should have guessed,
That it would end up like this, yet I do my best.
To hold it all inside.
Hiding from the deepest part of the mind.

I unwind, I unravel,
I roll up my sleeves, think of knives.
Think of memories.
And soon more I unravel.
