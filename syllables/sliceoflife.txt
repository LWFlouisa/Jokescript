I consider myself a fan of movies.
For me it's not any movie with blood and gore,
But ones with toxic masculinity galore
	I dislike.
You'll only ever see a flying head

Of someone gendered male from the homestead,
But never a noggin gendered female
On the great big theater screen,
Only in uncut additions at the homestead.
	Until very recently in Hollywood films.

Regardless of how one may view a princess,
With her long white flowing gown,
I sometimes want her head to roll,
With blood on the floor,
And seeing her lovely bride or groom frown.

I'm not terribly sure what that makes me,
Besides a connisseur for blood on the floor,
Or in a whicker basket, beheld to crowds galore.

I suppose that's way I like this genre,
I like to call it, slice of life.
