Oh make my forget,
	Lonely petals wither.

Oh make me forget,
The petals of red, flying,
To the sky, my grasp denying,
A tender touch of the hand,
	Lonely petals wither.

And falls to the floor,
Falling, falling, to the flloor.

When the petals fly away,
Nothing ever goes away,
Yet it is not a comfort, for my sorrows,
Tears pouring from my marrows,
	Lonely petals wither.

I raise my hand to the sky,
Hoping for nothing to deny.

Hoping for nothing,
	To forget.
