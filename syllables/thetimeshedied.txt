The girl with black rose
	Who also saw wind
	Wanted to unwind,
	Walked
		Alone in the night.
		Are the shadows on wall
		Searching for relief?
Gently walked, arose
In the midnight stars
Holding a guitar,
	That was old, frail
		And
	Without tune.
	Wails
		For many injuries,
		Scars from ages past
		Now bygone.
For her life ajar
	In her new life.
	With all changes
	She balks
		Alone in the night.
		She had nightmares of the
		Time she died.
