They are knocking, at my door,
In that rhythm, I abhor,
Knocks and voices, calling my name,
You may think, they look quite tame,
	Those beings I abhor.

Those faces knocking, at my door.
When you open, there in the door,
Satan laughing, havng his lark,
"Can we come in." they request,
	Voices at my behest.

Being knocking at my door,
In that rhythm, I abhor,
Satan laughing, havng his lark,
His children knockng at my door,
	A phone they request, I abide.

For the being knocking, knocking at my door,
	Those B.E.K.s I abhor.
