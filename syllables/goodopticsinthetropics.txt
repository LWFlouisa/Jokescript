The left proposes good optics,
While the ring leaders live in the tropics.
One could suppose bad mouthing is off topic,
But they say that is myopic.

Indeed, for some on the left,
Whom find themselves quite daft,
They never got past the first draft.
Indeed, for some on the left,
	There is no such thing as a second half.

For me I just once to be nice,
	Even if all I ever manage to do,
Is to move away and live in Nice.
	I suppose for my own life,
There is only some vague sense of peace.
	As long as you can pay your lease.

Whether you're in the weather for the fleece,
Or swimming the waves on the coast of Greece,
At some point one must learn to let things go,
Even as the world slowly becomes snow.

Because at the end of the day,
	When all is said and done,
The only way to escape the fire,
	Is to loud mouth with rum,
And hope the climite sorts itself out,
	And one lives to see another day.

For me I just once to be nice,
	Even if all I ever manage to do,
Is to move away and live in Nice.
	I suppose for my own life,
There is only some vague sense of peace.
	As long as you can pay your lease.

I'd rather help friends pay their lease,
And sort the rest out on another day.
