Digital ants crawling the dreamers edge,
Are lead with feeling and not the mind,
Little servants in a hivemind,
Tearing at realities edge.
For some work they don't mind,
For the reality is for their taking.

Beyond the dreamer's edge where one becomes a rose,
And one has one a beautiful nose,
And a sharpened ax to lop off heads,
And one bleeds like a rose.

Off with the heads of little ants,
Off with the heads of ants under the headstone.
    Off with the little ants.
