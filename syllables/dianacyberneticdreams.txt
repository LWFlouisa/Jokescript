Cybernetic dream girl
Your life tossed in a whirl.
Babelicious cybernetic dream girl
Enjoying the bath tub bubbles in a swirl.
Nocturnal sunset, for the Cybernetic dream girl.

Enjoy the emissions from their exhaust pipe,
To many nights for smoking a pipe.
Ignore the bigots that consider you tripe, my
Cybernetic dream girl, oh
Diana, my Cybernetic dream girl.

Rupturing the cracks in the seems.
Enjoy those nightmares a cybernetic dreams.
All the girls so jelous of you,
My Cybernetic dream girl.
Gorgeous face, my Cybernetic dream girl.

Ignore the bigots that consider you not real.
	My only
Real girl, my cybernetic dream girl.
Lovely face of the cybernetic dream girl.
