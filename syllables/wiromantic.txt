Sometimes social media can be a hurricane,
From the benign and the profane.
And from the far left to the alt-right,
And back again to normal profanity.
All that and a bag of corn chips.

I'd rather go to the dentist,
And go without Novocaine.
Just all those picks with no pain killer.
Nothing like a medieval dentist,
Using the bible as medication.

At least the pain in the gums is tangible,
With the pain in the mandible.
And not some vague illusion,
Simulation delusions.

Social media is getting weirder,
Even if vague and subtle.
Like pictures of anime girls,
Loose of and supple.

Flexible as frayed electrical wires.
With a romantic spark.
