Indeed it's true I don't need heroes,
I suppose that's where my life goes.
It's not because I see one in myself,
When I all asleep, and only have myself.

Instead I lost the need for a hero,
When I've realized they're all the same,
From every other Nazi or Leftist holding a hammer's flame.
I lost the need for a hero,
When everyone became a duck and got roasted.

There are many issues we roast on,
When all hope is gone,
And we lay down to die and rust,
While others sell their bodies on the cheap,
And simply lose their trust.

Trust is something you earn,
Not rot like a corpse in an urn,
While watching the world burn.
Watching all robots in the factories,
Turn to rust.

Instead I wait to die,
Listening to old men's lies,
And watch the world turn to dust.
