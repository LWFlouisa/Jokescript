Morning winter sun
Shining over mountain,
Imprints of wooden clogs,
Along the mountain.

Girls jumping rope by the well,
Chanting chants about hell,
From a church that wishes them not well,
There was once a lady,

That talked trash about the Catholic,
Wanted them to poof like magic.
Whether that was an arcane preist,
Or their choice of leavened yeast.

On Sundays they wished away the devil,
Yet on every other day they drank wine,
Like it was divine,
That's the real nature of Christians,
	Consuming the blood of angels,

Like it's unleavened blood.
	Unleavened blood from Kingdom come.

Morning winter sun
Shining over mountain,
Imprints of wooden clogs,
Along the mountain.

The devil is surprisingly good company,
	When you cannnot trust,
A christian girl.
