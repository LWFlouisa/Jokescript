You can be pragmatic,
While others are emotionally didactic.
I had a friend who led their life with their mind,
While I let my emotions about issues unwind.

Whether it's the death penalty,
Or if it's private prisons,
You should always lead with feeling,
And not what's in the bank.

As it is its own private prison,
While you let your mind do the wank.

I had once liked guillotines,
Because I liked the blood.
Because I always hated suffering,
For the people in the hood.

You can be pragmatic,
While others are emotionally didactic.
I had a friend who led their life with their mind,
While I let my emotions about issues unwind.

Because of this you need to lead with feeling,
And not what's in the bank.
Because when you go with money in the bank,
Then those desires can quickly change.
And you become a wank.

And that is worse than private prisons,
When that's how you choose to wank.
