One might think we can communicate,
That we can ignore our differences.
And yet, as others note, there is no communication,
When we don't speak the same language,
While using the same words on the page.

One might think we can communicate,
When one means abstract in a specific sense,
While another means abstract to mean super vagueness,
Everything at all, never seems to make sense.
I sure wish I had the answers.

But nothing in this world makes sense,
Not when we say such diferent things,
While using the same words on the page.
I sure wish I had the answers,
But I sure realize I know nothing,
But my own words on the page.

One might think we can communicate,
That we can ignore our differences.
And yet, as others note, there is no communication,
When we don't speak the same language,
While using the same words on the page.

Sometimes you have to let things go,
And agree with what you can,
And start a movement through what you can agree on,
And let the other things go.
