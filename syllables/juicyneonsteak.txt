All hail the juicy neon steak,
With it's tap dancing bones,
Perhaps the meat on its bones,
Vibrates all the constant dial tones.

All hail the juicy neon steak,
With its flesh decked out in blue,
All on the stars in neon skies,
Make the fromage purple ad green,
Like painted wooden shoes.

All hail the juicy neon steak,
With its Synthwave spirit, a shake
Of the rhythm, of that juicy neon steak.
Taste of radiation down the hatch,

I suppose I'm irradiate
Another batch.
