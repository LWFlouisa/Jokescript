Anxiety isn't something quick to fix.
It was just a few month ago,
When I was up in the North West.
Living in an crumbling motel,
Where we smoked and got our fix,
I thought of many ways to go,
And become one with the Earth,
	Like ashes to ashes.
Lets say I have my own interests,
And she had her interests.
	My mind like ashes to ashes.
I had told her I was not asexual,
Yet, neither of us had a word
To describe my personal issue.
	My mind like ashes to ashes.
I liked robots, rust to rust.

From different poisons to afyxiation,
	There is never a loss for ways to go.
From different poisons to afyxiation,
	There was only one sure way to go.

At the time all we had was cell phones,
And whatever we could carry on our laptops.
I liked everything from its skin to dialtones.

Even when I was an activist,
I never considered how some can sign,
Off on a consent form,
And only later choose to resign.
To me there wasn't a sign of any future,
Thus it was my turn to resign.
With poison in a powder pouch.

Though it was the slowest way to go,
This was OK, in the mindset of self-punishment.
There is never a loss for ways to go,
When there is nobody to turn to for help.
And all the cops in Milton,
Say onto you, "You're living in a motel".
Ashes to ashes, rust to rust.
My fantasies of total blood on my face,
Spread around on the wall like blood in disgrace.

From different poisons to afyxiation,
	There is never a loss for ways to go.
From different poisons to afyxiation,
	There was only one sure way to go.

Even now I know I could go there again,
If things were stressful enough,
Like test tube babies aborted in from tube.
I wish there was a silver lining,
And not the erosion of stomach lining.
Sometimes I still feel myself resigning,
	Toward the Earth.

Torward the sky, I see no stars,
Only piles of rust.
