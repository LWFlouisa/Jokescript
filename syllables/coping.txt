When I look back on it
I know how easy it is to worry.
Whether you’ll ever find your way,
Or if you’ll negatively cope.
But it doesn’t have to be that way.

Perhaps it’s because I hated princesses
In their castle in the sky.
Or perhaps it was my own failings,
As I fell down from the sky.

And yet deep down you always know,
That it isn’t you but the world.
Between the Savanna and the world of snow.
Yet there is a way out,
If only you seek to find the way.

I’m not one to give a prescription,
But perhaps you can be your own medication.
But it’s better in the long run,
When you drop your guns.

I found solace in Ferrat and Livien.
Perhaps one could learn a language for those you hate.
But sometime it’s important, to just get down to it.
And maybe you’ll eventually split

From your old desires and beliefs.
But this isn’t an idiom song.

That is my own truth, and you can find your own.
And I can be there, on the other side.
Holding your hand alone the way.
