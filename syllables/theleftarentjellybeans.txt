In this world I call my home,
That seems to have outlasted Rome,
There is no guillotine or a dictator per say,
Only ugly voices on the internet every day.

You’ll always find someone to argue with,
It’s almost like they want vegans to be a minority group.
They think of themselves as a troop,
When all they do is whine about Birkenstocks,
Without caring about what you think.

In this world I call my home,
That seems to have outlasted Rome,
There is no guillotine or a dictator per say,
Only ugly voices on the internet every day.

Perhaps the solution is so simple,
Don’t be a legionnaire or a trooper,
Vegans are almost like shit.
You wouldn’t even toss them down the drain.

It’s a worse polluter than a landfill,
And I suspect many are shills,
For frozen dinners and Jelly beans.
All that with no frills.

In this world I call my home,
That seems to have outlasted Rome,
There is no guillotine or a dictator per say,
Only ugly voices on the internet every day.

So lets not gate keep the left,
And act like Jelly Beans,
All flushing down the sink.
While critiquing people's Birkenstocks.
