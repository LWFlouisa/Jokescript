Winter season
Rain drops pouring down
The chilling drain.

Beyond the window light is a bedroom,
Midnight only starlight,
Fountain pens nibbed, stories down the pen,
Or may never read a bit of text again,

Within the bed are distant dreams,
Some of which one may scream,
But only the echoes call,
To give one comfort.

I'm no datapoint for
The shadow
On the wall.
