In these notes
For Mmujin Rose
Cealed
In ancient chest
Now in its long rest,
Peeled
Is the lid on box
Covered in chalk,
Dusting.

One could suppose in that old box,
Are old children's toys for a lovely girl.
Yet instead are different toys for someone not her gender.
It was someone meant to be a boy.
A plight for many a trans girl, not a boy.
And not for the girl with roses in her hair.
She desires amulents of a different flavor everywhere,
In the house of a solitary moonlight.
In the house of solitary moonlight, where the cat always crawls on the wooden fance,
It costs only a tupence, for some feed.
If only could simply be born a normal girl,
And not live to bleed.

In these notes
For Mmujin Rose
Cealed
In ancient chest
Now in its long rest,
Peeled
Is the lid on box
Covered in chalk,
Dusting.

She wilts for her own sake,
And for many others of her kin,
While drinking sake.

Under the moonlight gaze,
She sleeps.
