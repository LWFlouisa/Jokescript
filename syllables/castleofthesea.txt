Upon the land of rising sea,
Was once a shovel to see.
Where time stood still, and the
Youth in wooden shoes,
     Sang the blues of the sea.

When the sister laughed,
The other carried a shovel,
Then shifted the castle in half.
Come risig rifts, take the shovel
     Out to the rising sea.

Imprints of time forgotten,
Was not fruitful for the sand,
     Not begotten,
Many thoughts of the rising sea.
For sand given way to the sea.

Figments of memory of the sand,
Swim out to the sea.

Upon the land of rising sea,
Was once a shovel to see.
Where time stood still, and the
Youth in wooden shoes,
     Sang the blues of the sea.

Come enjoy the memory,
Swiiming out to the sea.
Swim out to the castle,
Of the rising sea.
