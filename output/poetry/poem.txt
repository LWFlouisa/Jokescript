They are knocking
 when I was bad in bed

As it rains down from above.

Can you see the deer running

     Sang the blues of the sea.

When the sister laughed

Chased by a wolf
 au contraire
To this Rospierre
 take the shovel
     Out to the rising sea.

Imprints of time forgotten
 to just get down to it.
And maybe you’ll eventually split

From your old desires and beliefs.
But this isn’t an idiom song.

That is my own truth
